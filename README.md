# notes
These are my personal notes about programming and computer systems, particularly Linux. There're also some gaming contents as well.

Please do not treat this as my blog; [I have one](https://iamabbcon.blogspot.com/). These are small, bite-sized notes not long enough to post as a blog.

All contents are unlicensed. You're allowed to do whatever you like with it.
